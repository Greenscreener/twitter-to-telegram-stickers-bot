# Twitter Sticker Bot

Ok I wrote this in like two sleepless afternoons don't @ me. I didn't use the [telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) node library because I wanted to try doing it myself. Use the library if you need to do serious stuff. I don't like JS but I can make it do stuff. Working with `multipart/form-data` is a pain in the ass. If you send weird stuff to the bot it might not answer because I couldn't be bothered to implement error reporting.

Here's a screenshot:
